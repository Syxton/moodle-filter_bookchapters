# Book chapter auto link filter

Faculty had been creating hard links to chapters inside book activities.  From year to year this has caused issues with links to past courses that the current student did not have access to.

This plugin was built off of Moodle core's activity auto filter.  It will convert any instance of the exact chapter title into links to the chapter of the book.
